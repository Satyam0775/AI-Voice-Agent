# 🏡 Riverwood AI Voice Agent – “Namaste, chai pee li?” ☕

This project showcases an intelligent and conversational **AI Voice Agent** built for **Riverwood Projects LLP**, designed to interact naturally with customers in both **Hindi and English**.  
The assistant reflects Riverwood’s warm, customer-first philosophy by offering casual greetings, remembering context, and delivering personalized construction updates.

## 💡 Concept

The idea behind the **Riverwood Voice Agent** is to humanize customer communication.  
Instead of automated responses, the AI engages users like a friendly representative — greeting them, remembering previous chats, and providing meaningful updates about their homes and site progress.

Each interaction feels personal, professional, and context-aware, aligning perfectly with Riverwood’s ethos:  
> “We don’t just build homes. We build stories.”

## 🎯 Core Objectives

- **Casual, Human Interaction**: Greet customers with natural warmth like *“Namaste Sir, chai pee li?”*  
- **Bilingual Understanding**: Understand and respond in **Hindi or English** automatically.  
- **Voice + Text Integration**: Allow both speaking and typing input modes with smooth switching.  
- **Real-time Speech Output**: Respond using lifelike voice via gTTS.  
- **Context Retention**: Remember previous messages to maintain conversational flow.  
- **Construction Update Simulation**: Provide site or progress updates dynamically.

## 🤖 How It Works

The AI uses **Google Gemini** to generate contextually rich responses based on user input.  
When the user speaks or types, the system:
1. Detects language (Hindi/English).  
2. Generates a warm, business-friendly reply.  
3. Speaks it aloud through gTTS for a natural experience.  
4. Saves memory context for continuity.  

The app also allows switching between **text chat** and **voice mode** for a hands-free experience.  
Voice mode mimics a real customer call, while text mode provides a chatbot-style interface.

## 🧠 AI Behavior Design

The model is trained to behave like a **Riverwood representative**, maintaining:
- **Warm tone** (friendly and respectful)  
- **Professional personality** (informative, concise)  
- **Cultural connect** (Hinglish-friendly)  
- **Local relevance** (updates tied to construction and project progress)  

Example Flow:
AI: Namaste Sir, chai pee li? Main Riverwood AI Voice Agent hoon. Kaise hain aap?
User: Haan ji, maine kal site visit kiya tha.
AI: Bahut accha Sir! Aapke ghar ka slab ka kaam complete ho gaya hai.
User: Great! How’s the clubhouse progress?
AI: The clubhouse flooring work is now 70% complete. Soon, we’ll start the finishing touches.
